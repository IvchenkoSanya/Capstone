            "Important concepts": "<p>\r\n\tAs you learn about the Dart language, keep these facts and concepts in mind:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tEverything you can place in a variable is an object, and every object is an instance of a class. Even numbers, functions, and <code>null</code> are objects. All objects inherit from the <code>Object</code> class.</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tAlthough Dart is strongly typed, type annotations are optional because Dart can infer types. In the code above, <code>number</code> is inferred to be of type <code>int</code>. When you want to explicitly say that no type is expected, use the special type <code>dynamic</code>.</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tDart supports generic types, like <code>List&lt;int&gt;</code> (a list of integers) or <code>List&lt;dynamic&gt;</code> (a list of objects of any type).</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tDart supports top-level functions (such as <code>main()</code>), as well as functions tied to a class or object (<em>static</em> and <em>instance</em> methods, respectively). You can also create functions within functions (<em>nested</em> or <em>local</em> functions).</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tSimilarly, Dart supports top-level <em>variables</em>, as well as variables tied to a class or object (static and instance variables). Instance variables are sometimes known as fields or properties.</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tUnlike Java, Dart doesn&rsquo;t have the keywords <code>public</code>, <code>protected</code>, and <code>private</code>. If an identifier starts with an underscore (<code>_</code>), it&rsquo;s private to its library. For details, see [[ link |&nbsp;dart-tour-libraries-and-visibility]]Libraries and visibility[[ endl ]].</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tIdentifiers can start with a letter or underscore (<code>_</code>), followed by any combination of those characters plus digits.</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tDart has both <em>expressions</em> (which have runtime values) and <em>statements</em> (which don&rsquo;t). For example, the [[ link | dart-tour-control-flow-statements]]conditional expression[[ endl ]] <code>condition ? expr1 : expr2</code> has a value of <code>expr1</code> or <code>expr2</code>. Compare that to an if-else statement, which has no value. A statement often contains one or more expressions, but an expression can&rsquo;t directly contain a statement.</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tDart tools can report two kinds of problems: <em>warnings</em> and <em>errors</em>. Warnings are just indications that your code might not work, but they don&rsquo;t prevent your program from executing. Errors can be either compile-time or run-time. A compile-time error prevents the code from executing at all; a run-time error results in an [[ link | dart-tour-exceptions]]exception[[ endl ]] being raised while the code executes.</li>\r\n</ul>"
